1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

The major feature that differentiates HTTP/2 from HTTP/1.1 is the binary framing layer. Unlike HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 uses a binary framing layer. This layer encapsulates messages – converted to its binary equivalent – while making sure that its HTTP semantics (method details, header information, etc.) remain untamed

2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
In JavaScript, objects are collections of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or symbols) and values can be of any data type, including other objects.

3.Read about IP address, port, HTTP methods, MAC address	
IP Address

An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network, such as the internet. It acts as a virtual address that allows devices to communicate and identify each other on the network. There are two main versions of IP addresses:

IPv4: The older version, consisting of four sets of numbers between 0 and 255, separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
IPv6: The newer version, with a more complex format using hexadecimal numbers and colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
Port

A port is a virtual communication channel associated with an IP address. It allows different applications or services running on the same device to receive and send data independently. Imagine an IP address as a building with multiple doors (ports), each leading to a specific apartment (application or service). Common port numbers include:

80: HTTP (web traffic)
443: HTTPS (secure HTTP)
21: FTP (file transfer)
25: SMTP (email)
HTTP Methods

HTTP methods are specific commands sent within an HTTP request to instruct the server on how to handle the request. These methods define the desired action on the server-side, such as retrieving data, creating new resources, or updating existing ones. Some common HTTP methods include:

GET: Retrieves data from the server, often used for fetching web pages or resources.
POST: Submits data to the server, typically used for submitting forms or creating new data.
PUT: Updates existing data on the server.
DELETE: Removes data from the server.
PATCH: Applies partial modifications to data on the server.
MAC Address

A MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique hardware identifier assigned to each network interface card (NIC) in a device. It’s used at the data link layer of the OSI model to ensure proper delivery of data frames within a local network segment. Unlike IP addresses, which can be dynamic and change, MAC addresses are typically burned into the hardware and remain static.
